              pull_request:
                branches: [ master ]     


- **gradle.yml:**: This yml file consists of build jobs to run the gradle build commands for building the Connector using Gradle upon pushing the changes to the configured branch.

              ./gradlew :WmTemplateProvider:assembleArtifact


#### jars:

            build.snapshot.reponame=connector-repository
